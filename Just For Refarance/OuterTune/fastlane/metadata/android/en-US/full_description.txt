<p><i>OuterTune</i> is a supercharged fork of <a href="https://github.com/z-huang/InnerTune" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">InnerTune</a>. This app is both a local media player, and a YouTube Music client.</p>

<li>Play local and Youtube Music songs at the same time</li>
<li>New integrated library screen design</li>
<li>Multiple queues</li>
<li>Synchronized lyrics, and support for word by word/Karaoke lyrics (e.g LRC, TTML)</li>
